# Data: Predict home prices using data from Melbourne, Australia, then write code to build a model predicting prices in the US state of Iowa. 

import pandas as pd

main_file_path = '../input/train.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(main_file_path)
print(data.describe())

# Note: imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the min. 
#       If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% 
#       of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced "25th percentile").
